On Primary DB
=============
1. Check the status of log_archive parameters:

SQL> set lines 999 pages 999
SQL> show parameter log_archive_config 
SQL> show parameter log_archive_dest

2. Identify the standby destination from the above (destination with SERVICE=... )

3. Check the archivelogs generated per thread:

SQL> select thread#,max(sequence#) from v$archived_log group by thread# order by 1;

4. Check the applied archivelog sequence# per thread:

SQL> select thread#,max(sequence#) from v$archived_log where applied='YES' group by thread# order by 1;

On Standby DB
=============
5. Check what is the last archivelog sequence received:

SQL> select thread#,max(sequence#) from v$archived_log group by thread# order by 1;

6. Check if the MRP process is running:

SQL> set lines 999 pages 999
SQL> select inst_id,process,status,client_process,thread#,sequence#,block#,blocks from gv$managed_standby order by 1,2;

7. If MRP is not running, then restart it using:

SQL> alter database recover managed standby database nodelay disconnect;

8. Check what is the sequence# and thread# MRP is trying to apply or waiting to be received

Fixing
======

If there is a gap between the generated archivelog on the Primary (Step-3) and Standby (Step-5) then 

1) Ensure the network connection between Primary and Standby are working 
2) If Network is working then:

a) Disable the archive log destination which does log shipping (from Step-2) and re-enable it on Primary:

SQL> alter system set log_archive_dest_state_2=DEFER;

b) Perform few log switches:

SQL> alter system archive log current;
SQL> alter system archive log current;
SQL> alter system archive log current;

c) Check the Primary alert.log and see if the archivelog shipping is generating any errors
d) Identify and fix any listener issues/erros if any 
e) Check the standby alert.log and see if the archive logs are received 
f) Check if the MRP is applying the logs (Step-6)
